### Static vs. voice snippets
Trained a 5-nearest-neighbor scikit classifier on ~1000 white noise and ~1000 voice snippets (from the an4 dataset). A held-out sample of ~20 white noise and ~20 voice samples were all classified correctly.

Repeating experiment with 1-nearest-neighbor classifier had same results.
